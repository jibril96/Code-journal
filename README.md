with first git bash activity i encountered some problems navigating to my file location, and after couple of failed attempts i was fortunate to collab with classmate, Maryam, and was able to navigate to specific file locations with her assistance.
Second activity was fun but annoying at the same time because i kept running into problems with git push, renaming the local master branch to main, and other technical difficulties. After struggling for some time trying to figure it out own my own, i reached out to Maryam and Hyeju for some clarity. Thanks to hyeju i was able to change branch from master to main. And i also would like to thank them both for helping me out with github and git bash.

some of the problems: 
17808@JIBRIL MINGW64 ~/documents/code-journal/my-repo (main)
$ git commit -m "add README to initial commit"
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
17808@JIBRIL MINGW64 ~/documents/code-journal/my-repo (main)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jibril96/code-journal .git
usage: git remote add [<options>] <name> <url>

    -f, --fetch           fetch the remote branches
    --tags                import all tags and associated objects when fetching
                          or do not fetch any tag at all (--no-tags)
    -t, --track <branch>  branch(es) to track
    -m, --master <branch>
                          master branch
    --mirror[=(push|fetch)]
                          set up remote as a mirror to push to or fetch from


17808@JIBRIL MINGW64 ~/documents/code-journal/my-repo (main)
$ git push --set-upstream origin main
fatal: https://github.com/jibril96/Code-journal#code-journal.git/info/refs not valid: is this a git repository?

hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

Yesterday and today i mainly focused on my assignment DSGN 270 Agile UX Breakdown. This assignment was slightly challenging because i had to use figma to create a user wireflow of a website, and it was quit confusing at first because i never used Figma before this assignment. However, after few mistakes, struggles, and even erasing some boxes i created for the project, i figured it out and was able to select the correct frames for the assignment. After that it was easier to recreate the web pages with figma to complete DSGN 270 Agile UX Breakdown project.

The objective is to frequently utilize figma because my instructor, Tony, said we will use it more in the program and it is for everyone's best interest to get used it as soon as possible. With that in mind, i want to master figma if that is possible. And i will probably practice on it as much as possible and watch some youtube tutorials on it to strengthen my skills at using it the best way there is. Just to end it off, i would like to say that i like the goals i am setting right now because like before with git bash i was in the same position, but after repeated steps and practices almost everyday i can admit i am not as bad as i was when i started using the terminal. With this type of realistic game plan i can get good at using figma the right way, or anything else.

## First assignment of CPNT-260-A

### Today’s goaI is to complete HTML and CSS Wikipedia article assignment.
* In today’s class the instructor gave lessons on HTML and CSS.
* I just found random article called ‘Old Exe Bridge’ on Wikipedia.
* Using  <header> </head>  was able to complete one section on HTML.
* When it came to trying out what the teacher taught I struggled with it at first.
* By playing around on Codepen with HTML and CSS, and Ash’s help, I got better with it.
* Ash explained to me how to add HTML first and then style it with CSS code: Header{ }.
* After Ash helped me out with CSS I was able to figure out how to apply it on the rest of HTML.
* I applied P{text-align: color:}.
* After adjusting and readjusting back and forth and applying new codes like <div>  <img src=” “>  </> I was able to finish my wiki article activity and submit it.
